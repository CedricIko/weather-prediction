PROJECT DESCRIPTION
As a data scientist at an energy provider, you're tasked with exploring the feasibility of a new service amidst rising energy costs. The company aims to offer complimentary energy to local customers residing near renewable energy sources during periods of surplus energy. To test this concept, the company plans to conduct a pilot project in May 2024, targeting a subset of customers. However, before implementation, they require a reliable predictive system capable of forecasting energy surpluses, particularly from wind or solar sources, at least 24 hours in advance. This system will enable the company to notify customers in the vicinity, allowing them to opt-in for the complimentary energy slots.
To develop such a system, you're provided access to historical data spanning from 2000 to the present day in the area. The company's primary concern is minimizing false positives, as inaccurately identifying surplus energy periods could result in financial losses from providing free electricity when not warranted, thus incurring high costs for the company.
